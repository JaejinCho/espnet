- This is to utilize git for better tracking of codes at least from this moment (as of 20210226) starting after the commit (bb05e992aa84677c882e0c444889acb9c0baef1e). Note that most of the codes in that commit were NOT written in an orginized way, most of which were generated in a messy way. ****** I need to spare some time to combine relavent codes to reduce # scripts.
